/**
 * The compiled statements the message-move paths issue, plus the helpers that
 * run them.
 *
 * Why this file exists
 * --------------------
 * Every move — a single one, a 100-message aggregated batch, or a chunk of a
 * 40 000-row background job — reaches the same handful of SQL statements
 * through the same code. Building them with `db.prepare` at the point of use
 * meant a 40 000-message job paid 240 000 `sqlite3_prepare` calls (measured:
 * 4.6s of the job's runtime) for SQL text that is byte-identical every time.
 * The statements are compiled once per database handle here and replayed with
 * the caller's bound parameters.
 *
 * Shape and lifecycle
 * -------------------
 * * Scope: keyed by the `DatabaseHandle` in a `WeakMap`, so a statement can
 *   only ever be handed back to the connection it was compiled against — a
 *   statement compiled for one database is never run against another, and the
 *   cache entry disappears with the handle it belongs to. A caller that wraps
 *   the handle in a proxy (the test-side `memoizingDb`) gets its own entry,
 *   which is the safe direction: a miss costs a compile, never a mismatch.
 * * Threading: the whole server is single-threaded and every move runs inside
 *   an already-serialized account write slot, so a lazily-built statement is
 *   compiled by the same synchronous call stack that first needs it. There is
 *   no await between the "is it compiled?" check and the assignment.
 * * Transaction boundary: this module never opens, extends or closes a
 *   transaction. Statements are compiled *outside* any transaction and only
 *   ever run inside the transaction their caller already opened, so each
 *   message keeps its own single-message transaction exactly as before.
 * * Laziness is load-bearing, not an optimization: the duplicate-destination
 *   statements only ever run for a message that has a `remote_id_lookup`, and
 *   the pending-reconciliation statements only ever run on a server without
 *   UIDPLUS. Compiling a statement the path would never execute would turn a
 *   conditional into an unconditional one, so every statement is compiled on
 *   first use and never before.
 *
 * Is replaying one Statement across transactions safe?
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * Yes, and it is what better-sqlite3 itself does: its `db.transaction()`
 * implementation keeps one prepared BEGIN / COMMIT / ROLLBACK / SAVEPOINT /
 * RELEASE / ROLLBACK TO set per connection in a `WeakMap` and re-runs them for
 * every transaction (`node_modules/better-sqlite3/lib/methods/transaction.js`),
 * so statement reuse across transaction boundaries is a property the driver
 * already depends on. Each `.run()/.get()/.all()` call resets the statement and
 * rebinds its parameters, so nothing from a previous call — including a
 * rolled-back one — survives: bindings are per-call, `changes` /
 * `lastInsertRowid` are per-call results, a read statement never pins a
 * snapshot, a statement created before an `ALTER TABLE` is re-prepared by
 * SQLite and keeps working, and a statement used inside a transaction still
 * sees that transaction's own uncommitted writes. `tests/sync-move-statements.test.ts`
 * pins all of that down against the real driver.
 *
 * Nothing here interpolates a value into SQL: every user-supplied value is a
 * bound parameter, and the only thing that varies in a statement's text is the
 * number of `?` placeholders.
