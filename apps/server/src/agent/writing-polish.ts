/**
 * Language-only polish of the body the user is composing.
 *
 * This is the fourth host-initiated provider chat (after the title generator,
 * the retrieval expander and the translation reader), so it rides the same
 * seam — `collectAuxiliaryChatText`, which resolves to `AgentRuntime
 * .streamChat` — and never reaches for a provider adapter itself. Nothing here
 * opens a socket: the endpoint URL, its scheme and its host are validated
 * where every other provider is validated, in `provider-service.ts`.
 *
 * Two boundaries are inherited from the translation reader rather than
 * reinvented, because they are the same two questions asked about the same
 * bytes:
 *
 * 1. Cloud consent. A compose body is mail content. A cloud provider that the
 *    user never authorised to receive mail content must not see it, so the
 *    check is `summary.cloud && !summary.cloudContentConsent` → 403.
 * 2. Which model answers. A host-initiated call has no per-conversation
 *    provider to choose from, so it uses the single global default — the same
 *    one the retrieval expander and the auto-reply reviewer use. There is no
 *    per-recipient-account model in this product; see the report for the
 *    observed semantics.
 *
 * What polish is *not* is a rewrite. The prompt below is the whole contract:
 * it fixes the language, forbids changing meaning, facts, how the recipient is
 * addressed, and the set of points, and demands the polished body alone so the
 * caller can substitute it into the textarea verbatim.
