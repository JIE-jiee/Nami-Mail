/**
 * The host makes a few model calls that no user turn asked for: naming a
 * conversation after its first message, reviewing an inbound mail before the
 * auto-reply pipeline drafts anything. They are ordinary provider chats and
 * they belong on the same seam as a conversation turn — `AgentRuntime
 * .streamChat` — for one concrete reason: a test that stubs that one method
 * must never be surprised by a real outbound request. A side door around it is
 * how a hermetic suite quietly starts paying DNS latency it never budgeted
 * for, and it also means a future call added next to these can miss the seam
 * without anything noticing.
 *
 * They still carry a caller because the runtime's request type asks for one.
 * `service` is the honest kind (the host asked, not a user or a paired
 * caller), and the call authorizes nothing: empty scopes and no account scope,
 * because this request invokes no tool and reaches no mailbox.

 * Runs one auxiliary chat to completion and reduces the runtime's event stream

 * accumulated up to that point rides along in the outcome so each caller
 * decides what an error means for it — the title generator drops it, the
 * retrieval expander salvages the terms that arrived before the abort.
 *
 * The optional knobs exist because the host's auxiliary calls are not all the
 * same shape, and none of them may reach for the provider adapter to get their
 * shape back:
 *
 * - `signal` cancels the stream. The runtime turns a cancelled stream into an
 *   `error` event rather than a throw, so a caller that treats cancellation as
 *   "keep what you have" must recognise it by its own signal.
 * - `onDelta` forwards each token as it lands, for a transport that streams
 *   progress instead of waiting for the whole answer.
 * - `maxCharacters` stops consuming once the answer is long enough to be worth
 *   parsing. Breaking out of the loop returns the runtime's generator, which
 *   closes the provider stream underneath it.
