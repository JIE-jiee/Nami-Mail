/**
 * The single source of truth for the `code` field the local HTTP API puts on an
 * error body.
 *
 * Before this module every route spelled its own string literal, so the same
 * meaning reached the wire under three shapes: a zod failure answered
 * `invalid_argument` on one route and `invalid_request` on another, a missing
 * resource answered `not_found` on one route and no `code` at all on the rest,
 * and an Agent failure answered the upper-snake `AgentServiceError` code. A
 * client could not branch on `code` without a per-route, per-case table.
 *
 * The vocabulary is deliberately a *routing-layer* module rather than a
 * contracts package. `docs/LOCAL-API` states that the loopback Fastify service
 * is a protected desktop-renderer protocol, not a third-party API, and it
 * promises only that callers "must branch on HTTP status and a stable `code`" —
 * it never enumerates the values. Putting the list in `@nami/agent-contracts`
 * would publish the renderer's private vocabulary as if it were the external
 * Mail v1 contract, and would make the frozen Agent/Broker vocabulary below
 * look renameable from the server side.
 *
 * Four families reach the wire, and only the first one is owned here:
 *
 * 1. `ROUTE_ERROR_CODES` — this module. Lower-snake, one code per meaning.
 * 2. `MAIL_ERROR_CODES` — mail transport classification, owned by `../mail.js`.
 * 3. `OAUTH_ERROR_CODES` / `TRANSLATION_SERVICE_ERROR_CODES` — typed unions in
 *    `../oauth.js` / `../translation.js` that have no runtime array, so they
 *    are spelled out here and pinned to their union by `satisfies` plus the
 *    `Exclude` probes below. A member added upstream without a row here is a
 *    compile error, not a silent wire change.
 * 4. `AGENT_ERROR_CODES` — the Agent/Broker vocabulary from
 *    `@nami/agent-contracts`. It is UPPER_SNAKE and it is FROZEN: it is the
 *    documented external Mail v1 vocabulary (docs/EXTERNAL-MAIL-INTERFACE,
 *    docs/cli/output-schema, docs/mcp/security, docs/cli/permissions) and the
 *    renderer branches on it case-sensitively (`AgentWorkspace.tsx` and
 *    `agent/agent-utils.ts` compare against the literal "NOT_FOUND",
 *    `AgentMcpServerPane.tsx` against "SERVER_CHANGED",
 *    `AgentProviderSettings.tsx` against "PROVIDER_AUTH_FAILED" and
 *    "PROVIDER_CHANGED"). `agentFailure` in `routes/agent.ts` passes those
 *    through verbatim, so the HTTP surface carries the documented spelling
 *    rather than a second, lower-cased variant. Uppercase reaching a client is
 *    therefore a declared, owned value — not vocabulary drift.
 *
 * `tests/route-error-codes.test.ts` scans every file in this directory and
 * fails on any `code` literal outside the union below, so a new spelling is a
 * red test rather than a silent fourth dialect.
