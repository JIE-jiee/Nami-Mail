/**
 * The one local-service startup sequence.
 *
 * The desktop has exactly two ways to bring the mail service up: the first
 * launch (`boot`) and crash recovery (`restartLocalServiceAfterCrash`). They
 * used to be two hand-written copies of the same steps — load the master key,
 * fork the utility process, apply the desktop-only settings, put the renderer
 * back on the new service, restore the Agent broker — and they had already
 * drifted: recovery silently skipped the settings step, and its window reload
 * could fail into a `console.error` that a packaged install never shows. The
 * next step boot grows is the step recovery silently misses, so the sequence
 * lives here once and both callers supply the same effects.
 *
 * Electron stays out of here: `main.mts` supplies the effects (key, fork,
 * window, broker, logging, dialogs) and this module owns the order and the
 * failure policy. First-launch-only work (startup timings, the desktop smoke
 * progress file, splash dismissal, pairing requests) arrives through optional
 * hooks, so a recovery run never executes a smoke probe.
